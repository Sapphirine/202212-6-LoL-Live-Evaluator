    Define the RNN model that we make use of for our live predictions. Since our live API dosen't give us golddiff like
    it does for match_id, we make predictions without this feature, thus making the total number of features '6' instead.
    Note that this did not drastically affect our accuracy during testing, and should thus still work fine.
